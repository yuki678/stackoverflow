## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
Download data from https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey and unzip to your data/[year] directory (e.g. data/2019/survey_results_public.csv, survey_results_schema.csv).

## Project Motivation
The survey page itself has nice charts and graphs to visualise the result.
However, I worndered if this is really applicable to myself, so analyse the data by country.

## File Description
* src/Comp_EDA.ipynb - Include all source code to analyse stackoverflow developer suvery data.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
